## Libraries

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

By the way, xmpp.org features [a new page about XMPP RFCs](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   No XEPs proposed this month.

### New

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0465](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0465.html) (Pubsub Public Subscriptions)
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2022-04-13. (XEP Editor (jsc))
-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0466](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0466.html) (Ephemeral Messages)
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2022-05-03. (XEP Editor (jsc))

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version 0.3 of [XEP-0365](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0365.html) (Server to Server communication over STANAG 5066 ARQ)
    -   Make use of SLEP Streaming service, which was not available for 0.1. This provides a better service mapping than direct use of 5066 and provides compression. (sek)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

-   No Last Call this month.

### Stable

-   No XEPs advanced to Stable this month.

### Deprecated

-   No XEP deprecated this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.
